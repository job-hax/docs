# JobHax Backend REST API 

## Overview

JobHax is a platform that allows you to track your job applications, their statuses, take some notes about them and see some metrics about your job seeking process. The JobHax API provides functionality to developers to create users, add job applications and all the related endpoints to manage them. All of the API endpoints work with JSON bodies and responses.

## Authentication
The JobHax API uses Django framework's OAuth system. In order to get an access_token to access the endpoints, you'll need to have a JobHax client_id and a JobHax client_secret. You can get an access_token either using email&password or using a third party access token like (Google access token, LinkedIn access token etc.)
