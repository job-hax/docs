# Contribution Process

1. We not have projects set up in backend \([https://github.com/job-hax/backend/issues](https://github.com/job-hax/backend/issues)\) & frontend \([https://github.com/job-hax/frontend/projects](https://github.com/job-hax/frontend/projects)\) 
2. We will be adding issues there as they come up & also new feature work If you are working on something, please assign to yourself so we don't have multiple people working on same tasks.
3. When you create a PR, make sure to attach the issue to the PR \([https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)\).
4. This way issues get automatically moved to appropriate column. 
5. Whoever is reviewing the PR's, don't merge without issue attached! We have lots of members & work now, don't want duplicate work happening
